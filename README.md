# Bitcoin-Markets
This application monitors the Bitcoin markets with live up to the second data. It accomplishes this by converting  a web page from bitcoinity.org to a local application for easier use. You can change the Bitcoin units from mBTC to BTC in the top right corner under preferences. Future features are planned, so stay tuned.

Remember the days when Bitcoin was that low and Mt.Gox was around? This is obviously an old screenshot since Mt.Gox was removed, and now Kraken is in its place. I will provide an updated one soon.
